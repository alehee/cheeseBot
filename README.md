Simple discord bot written in Python. Purpose of this project is to learn some bot-writing basics, so if you want to check some examples feel free! All of the documentation I used can be found in [discordpy docs](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Bot is written for single server handle only, so the database is a simple json file. If you want go worldwide with your bot prepare some proper database server!

All bot commands are triggered by '>' sign before the command.

## Commands
```
    >check
        prints if i'm alive and timestamp of the message
```

## Used technology
* Python 3

## Packages
* discord.py
* json

## Download and installation
You can download the master branch with code.

If you're trying to run it on yourself you need to prepare your token and save it in directory as *token.json*
```json
{
    "token": "your_token_here"
}
```
